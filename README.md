# ui-framework
Another UI Framework built using VanillaJS

This is a personal UI Framework built inspired using different technology and patterns available over the internet. The main influence of this is Knockout.JS. Some implementaiton are based from Vue and React.

Here are the list of features it currently supported
- Basic routing and view
- First level model two-level data binding
- Templating and Custom Elements

Will keep this repository updated as much as possible to come pass as a industry standard framework.
